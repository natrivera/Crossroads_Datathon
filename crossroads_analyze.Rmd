## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

`

#NR --Added the joins, but still need to clean the data. Some columns are not numeric and need to change the dashes to 0s
df <- train %>% 
  left_join(train_ex , by = c('BusinessDate' , 'BranchID' )) %>% 
  left_join(holidays , by = c("BusinessDate" = "HolidayDate"))
